Hello! My name is Lutfi Aryadi Sukmono.

This is my second Capstone Project as Student at Purwadhika Digital Technology School, focuses on analyzing SaaS (Software as a Service) sales data from 2020 to 2023.
The main objective is to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to gain insights into Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount, and Customer Segmentation.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools & Libraries**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel/CSV (Data Storage)

üîë **Process**

1. Data Understanding
- Explore dataset structure (Row ID, Order ID, Order Date, Customer, Segment, Sales, Quantity, Profit, Discount, etc.).
2. Data Cleaning
- Ensure consistent data types (e.g., date, numeric).
- Export cleaned data into .csv.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Sales, Profit, and Quantity analysis by customer segment.
- Discount impact analysis on Sales, Quantity, and Profit.
- Conduct T-Test to evaluate the statistical difference between discounted vs non-discounted transactions.
4. Create visualizations using bar plots, line plots, and correlation heatmaps.
- Key Insights
- Enterprise segment contributes the most in terms of total Sales and Profit.
- Strategic segment outperforms on an average per-customer basis (big deals).
- Discounts do not significantly increase Sales or Quantity, but they reduce Profit across all segments.
